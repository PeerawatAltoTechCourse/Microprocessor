- The purpose of BRNE is to *"alter"* the program flow based on the result of a comparison or subtraction operation.

- [WORD] "alters the program flow," it means that it changes the sequence in which instructions are executed by redirecting the execution to a different location in the code.

- The BRNE instruction checks *a condition flag* , typically *the zero flag*, before *branching*.

-  If the condition flag is *not set* (i.e., not equal to zero), the branch is taken, and the program *jumps* to a *specified label or address*.
   And the program continues executing the next instruction sequentially.

- In assembly code, BRNE is commonly used to *create loops* and *conditional branching*.

- It allows the program to repeat *a certain block* of code or skip over specific instructions based on the *outcome of a previous operation*.

- By using BRNE, programmers can control the program flow and implement decision-making logic.

**Unconditional branch instruction**


**JMP**

- JMP is an unconditional jump that can go to any memory location of AVR

- The purpose of JMP is to *unconditionally* alter the program flow by directing the execution to a specified label or address.

- The JMP instruction is often used for implementing loops, subroutines, or for directing the program flow to specific sections of code based on certain conditions determined by the programmer.

- It provides flexibility and control over program execution.
